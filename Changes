Revision history for DBIx-Class-Migration.

        - Change required Version of File::Copy to 2.23, this allows better
          compatibility with perl 5.16 and higher 

0.056   2015-02-06
        - tweaked the dist.ini so that '.devdir' is found and gathered into
          the tarball.  This solves massive fail on cpantesters.

0.055   2015-02-05
        - Specify higher minimum versions to try and narrow down massive
          failure reports on CPAN testers.  Please give me a shout if any
          of these version minimum increases cause you trouble.

0.054   2015-02-05
        - Change use of deprecated config name in SQLT

0.053   2015-02-05
        - Even more careful disconnection on DEMOLISH

0.052   2015-02-05
        - Don't disconnect on DEMOLISH if the schema already is gone

0.051   2015-02-05
        - Removed postgresqlsandbox shutdown hack (I think this issue is long fixed
          in DBIC:DH and I can't honestly recall the exact problem...
        - Fixed bad test case that was not properly scoping $schema, leading to
          trouble.
        - More explicit disconnect of schema when the migration object goes out of
          scope.  This should reduce or eliminate "Cleanup" warnings when trying to
          shutdown Postgresql and the $schema is still connected.
        - Added some docs on the Postgresql sandbox helpers I added yesterday.

0.050   2015-02-04
        - New script helpers for Postgresql sandboxs
        - Corrected some dates in the changelog

0.049   2015-02-04
        - New feature 'db_sandbox_dir' which allows you to specify an alternative
          location for a sandbox.
        - Removed some Dzil components I didn't understand or seem to think I
          really benefitted from.

0.048     2015-02-20 17:00:51+00:00 Europe/London

        - marking as stable

0.04_7    2015-01-26 14:48:07+00:00 Europe/London

        - no changes from previous release, just removing examples from PAUSE indexing.

0.046     2015-01-26 03:10:37+00:00 Europe/London

        - Switch from Test::postgresql to Test::PostgreSQL
        ( the latter is a fork of the former )

0.04_5    2015-01-15 01:44:23+00:00 Europe/London

        - Don't use config_dir from DBIx::Class::Fixtures as a Path::Class::Dir,
          it no longer is one.

0.044   2013-20-35
        - POD fixs (MidLifeXis++)
        - fix probably where a --targetdir override is not probably recognized
        (agorman++)

0.043   2013-10-21
        - Another attempt to fix the regression caused by changes to
        ::DevShareDir

0.042   2013-10-16
        - Added a '.devdir' to 't/' to hopefully solve reported issues with
        the newest DevShareDir

0.041   2013-09-18
        - Changed changes file date spec to match CPAN::Spec.
        - Fix for changes in how inlined files are loaded, due to upstream 
          changes.  This fixes problems in loading the DBICM:Types modules.
        - Updated FAQ.

0.040   2013-09-05
        - Support specifying sql_translator_args from the Script wrapper. This
          can be used to specify the database version to be used in the SQL
          producer, for example.

0.039   2013-06-24
        - Fixed behavior when --target_dir is not specified.  There was a
          regression introduced in the previous version that tried to default
          target_dir to '/' if you don't specify it (unlike the previous and
          correct default which is to use the /share directoruy. (andyjones++)

0.038   2013-05-30
        - make a questionable test author side only until I can figure out
          what the problem is
        - fix a bug where if you specify the target_dir, DBICM partly ignores
          your wishes (Matthias Krull++)
        - POD fixes (Matthias Krull++)
        - Improve the error message you get around invalid or missing share
          directories (moltar++)
        - Other misc documentation updates and fixes

0.037   2013-01-10
        - Fixed regression introduced in v0.036 where non SQLite databases got
          deleted on multiple calls to the same migration object.  This is 
          considered a mandatory upgrade for users of v0.036 and the broken
          version will be eventually deleted from CPAN.

0.036   2013-01-02
        - New Feature: delete_named_sets: Allows you to delete dumped fixtures
          for given sets for the current schema version.
        - Fixed bug with downgrade.  Now if you downgrade but don't specify a
          'to-version' target, we do the right thing and downgrade one version.
        - Added upgrade and downgrade test cases to better catch possible
          future regressions.

0.035   2013-01-01
        - Allow you to control the db_sandbox_builder from a script, to make it
          easier to use alternative sandbox locations (make it easier to build
          a database sandbox in a temporary area for testing, for example).
        - Added a bit of documention to the temporary sandbox builder to give
          you a hint of what it might be for.
        - Happy New Year 2013!  Don't forget to register for an CPAN account
          this year and release some code!

0.034   2012-10-03
        - RunScript now tries to give you some advice if you invoke a method or
          a column on a source that doesn't exist in the generated schema.
        - New run script trait: 'Dump'.  This is the flipside of 'Populate' and
          makes it straightforward to build core fixture sets as part of your
          database installation.

0.033   2012-10-03
        - Refactored ::RunScript such that 'migrate' can use externally added
          traits.  Documented this.

0.032   2012-09-26
        - New run script trait: 'TargetPath'.
        - New command flag 'extra_schemaloader_args' which allows you to
          pass options to SchemaLoader when running migrations.
        - Documented some command options that I previously missed.

0.031   2012-09-25
        - Upped the dependency on DBIC:Fixtures to the latest version so that
          we get fixes related to Postgresql sequences.
        - Added a test case to make sure we populating fixtures with more
          complex table relationships works.
        - Allow you to invoke more than one command at a time, such as
          "dbic-migration install populate --fixture_set core"
        - New migration script trait 'Populate' that exposes a DBIC:Fixtures
          object to your run scripts, making it easier to use existing and
          previously dumped fixture sets in your install/upgrade/downgrade
          cycle.

0.030   2012-09-11
        - in t/help.t, specify minimum version of Capture::Tiny to get required
          functionality.
        - dbic_fixtures_extra_args and dbi_fixtures_extra_args attributes
          added to DBICM:Script so that you can better control your custom
          connections (useful when running migrations against existing dbs).
          (This feature is considered BETA, please report your experiences
          and we need docs / test cases).
        - 9/11 never forget and thank you to everyone who's stood strong these
          many years.

0.029   2012-09-05
        - Better error message when you forget to have a $VERSION in your
          schema_class (logie++)
        - skipping a version to resync oafter botched release (the previous
          release that was called 0.027 was really 0.028)

0.027   2012-09-04
        - Allow you to specify a migration class in the Catalyst DBIC Model
          Trait.  This will allow you to make direct use of any custom
          subclasses of DBIx::Class::Migration you may have written.
        - Lots of improvements to the commandline documentation.
        - Misc. documentation corrections.
        - Overall Documention corrections (pjcj++).

0.026   2012-08-02
        - Fixed typo in documentation (chromatic++)
        - added repository and other metadata to the distribution.
        - increased the minimum require version of MX:GetOpt to hopefully solve
          reported problems with older versions.
        - If you get the very common "Can't find source for..." error in your
          migration script, we now give you more details and debugging.
        - Started to create some custom subtypes so we can better control the
          error messages you get when making common mistakes at the commandline.

0.025   2012-07-05
        - Updated docs a bit to disambiguate the command 'version' and 'status'
        - you can now run the help command on your custom subclasses of
          DBIx::Class::Migration.

0.024   2012-06-05
        - Fixed method 'install_version_storage' to actually do what the
          documentation claims.  Added test case (++bentglasstube).

0.023   2012-05-03
        - Look harder for a sharedir

0.022   2012-04-11

        - fixed regression when using DBIC:DeploymentHandler v0.002112+
          (lxp@cpan.org++)
        - New Feature: We set  %ENV variables for key settings so that
          information is passed to install / up-downgrade scripts.

0.020   2012-03-28
        - fixed typo that caused new command added in 0.018 to fail (nour.sharabash++)
        - documentation typo fixes (logie17++)

0.019   2012-03-16
        - Fixed broken POD in the third part of the tutorial that prevented
          the page from being rendered.
        - Updated a number of dependencies to newer version to solve some
          reported problems.

0.018   2012-03-15
        - Documentation fixes (Volker++)
        - Project title change
        - ::SchemaLoader now more carefully preserves connection information
          from its target database (code cribbed from frew++)
        - new command: "dbic-migration install_version_storage", which lets you
          force install the versioning tables and metadate into a target DB.
          This could be useful if you have an existing database that you want
          to start versioning.

0.017   2012-03-14
        - POD and documentation fixes (logie17++)
        - new command: "dbic-migration diagram".  If GraphViz is installed will
          produce a png file of the current schema.  EXPERIMENTAL!

0.016   2012-03-12
        - More POD and documentation fixes  (Volker++), (logie17++)
        - changed the way I declare version requirements in my dist.ini filr
          in order address some bugs in the way version strings are interpreted
          in various versions of Perl.

0.015   2012-03-08
        - Minor typo fixes in the tutorial (Volker++)
        - FAQ entry regarding ubuntu + AppArmor and MySQL sandboxes (Volker++)

0.014   2012-03-07
        - Changed the way we depend on File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir

0.013   2012-03-05
        - upped DBIC:DH dependency version to take advantage of required
          fixes and overall improvements
        - If using an existing mysql sandbox, that is not running, if the
          socket directory is missing, we create it.
        - Test case for above problem.

0.012   2012-03-05
        - Upped Pod::Parser dependency version to close some reported test
          failures.
        - Documentation tweaks

0.011   2012-03-04
        - Added a bit to the FAQ regarding the extra warnings to STDOUT/ERR.
        - specify more modern version of some dependencies, since I am using the
          more modern features.

0.010   2012-03-02
        - The mysql sandbox no longer uses TCP networking.  This should make it
          possible to run parallel tests and have more than one user sharing a
          single development server.
        - Avoid infinite recursive when I can't infer the schema class (this
          fixes regression introduced in previous version).

0.009   2012-03-01
        - changed the way we look for a schema so that commands that don't need
          one (like help and version) can still run.
        - if a postgresql sandbox is already running, just use it and don't try
          (and fail) to start it again.
        - changed the mysql sandbox code so that when Test::mysqld is patched
          it will work just like postgresql does in the above change-line.

0.008   2012-03-01
        - Fixed failing test when optional dependency is not installed
        - help command now does something meaningful (felliott++)
        - test case for help command

0.007   2012-02-29
        - Catalyst::TraitFor::Model::DBIC::Schema::FromMigration now lets you
          set some connect_info args instead of deleting them.
        - silence some warnings about my unclear use of 'shift'
        - Fixed a use.t problem where I was trying to check a module that had
          optional dependencies
