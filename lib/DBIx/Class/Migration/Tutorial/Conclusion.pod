DBIx::Class::Migration::Tutorial::Conclusion - Final thoughts

=head1 GOAL

A quite recap and thoughts about where to go next.

=head1 SUMMARY

Nice to see you get this far!  I hope you now have the basic understanding
needed to be able to integrate migrations into your DBIC workflow, testing
and web development.  The next bit is up to you.  Use the tools, think about
where the gaps are, and give me some feedback.  Hopefully over time this
tutorial can become better and we can also start to create some basic recipes
for good approaches to common problems.  Thanks!

=head1 NEXT STEPS

You might find looking at L<DBIx::Class::Migration::FAQ> useful in debugging
some of the more common error messages that I've seen while preparing this
tutorial.

Also, at this point reviewing the API level documentation for
L<DBIx::Class::Migration> and L<DBIx::Class::Migration::Script> useful.  For
more on some of the testing stuff we covered see L<DBIx::Class::Migration::Population>
and L<Test::DBIx::Class>.

Lastly, its definitely a good idea to review the documention for both
L<DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler> and L<DBIx::Class::Fixtures> if you have not
already.  Looking at L<SQL::Translator> may not be a bad idea either.
