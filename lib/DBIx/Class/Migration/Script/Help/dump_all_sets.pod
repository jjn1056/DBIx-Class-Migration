For the current database version, dump data sets for all fixtures in the
fixtures configuration directory for that version.  If  the database is not
versioned, we assume the version is whatever you schema class is.

Required.  The fixture configuration set names (basically these are the file
names of your fixture configurations, without the '.json' part.

a development schema class.

This is the schema we use as the basis for creating, managing and running your
