=item Value

String that represents a filesystem path

=back

A directory path that is used to store your fixtures and migration
files.  By default this will be the C<share> directory for the application
where your L<DBIx::Class::Migration::Script/"schema_class"> resides.
I recommend you leave it alone since
this is a reasonable Perl convention for non code data, and there's a decent
ecosystem of tools around it, however if you need to place the files in an
alternative location (for example you have huge fixture sets and you don't
want them in you core repository, or you can't store them in a limited space
filesystem) this will let you do it.


When required you can also populate this option with the %ENV variable
DBIC_MIGRATION_TARGET_DIR.
